# ~Daily Blog~
## Thursday, March 26 2020
My day started with going to work as usual, nothing
  of any interest really happens. After my eight hour
  day, I decided to get started on my coding homework 
  the 'Markdown' lesson. I like to think that I was able
  to get the hang of it. Some time into the lesson I 
  recieved a message from one of my oldest friends, 
  informing myself and other close friends that he was 
  returning from his time in boot-camp! We all could not 
  be more proud of him and look forward to seeing him
  once he's home.

After finishing the markup I began working on this 
  blog and once finished I plan to add a number of 
  formatting elements from the 'Daring Fireball' link 
  provided for me into this very blog. I look forward to 
  seeing how it turns out. Once finished I plan to spend 
  a good amount of my weekend into bettering my 
  understanding on what I've learned on coding.
